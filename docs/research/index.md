Researchers use familiar tools within the TRE.
The environment provides a secured workspace and a workflow lifecycle that records methods and results for verification.

**Research tools (examples)**
- Interactive tools: RStudio, Jupyter.
- Statistical packages: SAS, Stata, MATLAB.
- Terminal and batch execution for pipelines.
- Single sign-on and session management.
